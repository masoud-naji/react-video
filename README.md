# React Image Accordion

A simple and customizable React component that creates an image accordion with smooth animation, inspired by Kevin Powell's tutorial on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJERnXiFFug&t=0s&ab_channel=KevinPowell).

The image accordion is a modern design pattern that can be used to display images and accompanying information in an interactive and engaging way. This component makes it easy to incorporate this pattern into your React projects.


## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install react-image-accordion.

```bash
npm i react-video-all-caption
```




## Usage

To use the component in your React application, import it and pass the necessary props:

```jsx
import ReactImageAccordion from 'react-video-all-caption';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <ReactVideoPlayer
      videopath: {videUrl},
      autoplay: true,
      captionurl: {captionurl},
      embedurl: {embedurltest},
      loop: true,
      muted: true,
      playPause: true,
      type: type,
      control: true,
    />
  );
}

```
